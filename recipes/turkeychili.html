    <h1>Turkey Chili with Beans</h1>

    <h2>The best chili you'll ever have</h2>
    <p>
      You might think of chili as an easy weeknight dish, but this turkey
      version from Pierre Franey will change your mind. It's fabulous, it's
      healthy, and it can be cooked in about a half hour. A combination of dark
      and white meat really adds depth and richness of flavor, so try to find a
      mix, but all white meat (or a mixture of ground beef and turkey) will
      yield a stellar batch too.

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oil over high in a large heavy pot and add the turkey meat.
        Cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes, chopping down and stirring
        with the side of a heavy kitchen spoon to break up any lumps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onions, garlic, sweet pepper, celery, jalape√±o, oregano, bay
        leaves, chili powder and cumin. Stir to blend well. Cook for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomatoes, chicken broth, salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a
        boil, reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the drained beans and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes
        longer. Serve in bowls with Cheddar, and sour cream and lime wedges, if
        desired.
